# Jenkins

The Jenkins Continuous Integration and Delivery server.

This is a fully functional Jenkins server, based on the Long Term Support release [http://jenkins-ci.org/](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

# How to use this image

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins
```

This will store the workspace in /var/jenkins_home. All Jenkins data lives in there - including plugins and configuration. You will probably want to make that a persistent volume:

```console
$ docker run --name myjenkins -p 8080:8080 -v /var/jenkins_home jenkins
```

The volume for the "myjenkins" named container will then be persistent.

You can also bind mount in a volume from the host:

First, ensure that /your/home is accessible by the jenkins user in container (jenkins user - uid 102 normally - or use -u root), then:

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /your/home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins
```

## Backing up data

If you bind mount in a volume - you can simply back up that directory (which is jenkins_home) at any time.

If your volume is inside a container - you can use `docker cp
$ID:/var/jenkins_home` command to extract the data.

## Attaching build executors

You can run builds on the master (out of the box) buf if you want to attach build slave servers: make sure you map the port: `-p 50000:50000` - which will be used when you connect a slave agent.

[Here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/maestrodev/build-agent/) is an example docker container you can use as a build server with lots of good tools installed - which is well worth trying.

## Upgrading

All the data needed is in the /var/jenkins_home directory - so depending on how you manage that - depends on how you upgrade. Generally - you can copy it out - and then "docker pull" the image again - and you will have the latest LTS - you can then start up with -v pointing to that data (/var/jenkins_home) and everything will be as you left it.

# Supported Docker versions

This image is officially supported on Docker version 1.8.2.
