# What is Alpine Linux?

[Alpine Linux](http://alpinelinux.org/) is a Linux distribution built around [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/) and [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/). The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a [package repository](http://forum.alpinelinux.org/packages) that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. [Read more about Alpine Linux here](https://www.alpinelinux.org/about/) and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.

# How to use this image

## Usage

Use like you would any other base image:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.1
RUN apk add --update mysql-client && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
```

This example has a virtual image size of only 16 MB. Compare that to our good friend Ubuntu:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:14.04
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y mysql-client \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
```

This yields us a virtual image size of about 232 MB image.
