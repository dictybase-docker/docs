# What is ownCloud?

ownCloud is a self-hosted file sync and share server. It provides access to your data through a web interface, sync clients or WebDAV while providing a platform to view, sync and share across devices easily—all under your control. ownCloud’s open architecture is extensible via a simple but powerful API for applications and plugins and it works with any storage.

# How to use this image

## Start ownCloud

Starting the ownCloud 8.1 instance listening on port 80 is as easy as the following:

```console
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 owncloud:8.1
```

Then go to http://localhost/ and go through the wizard. By default this container uses SQLite for data storage, but the wizard should allow for connecting to an existing database. Additionally, tags for 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0 are available.

### Caveat

When using the 6.0 image, you need to map the host port to the container port that apache listens on when going through the installation wizard. By default, this is port 80.
